<p>Hello !<br>
<br>
Recently graduated from a Master degree in graphic design,
I am currently realizing a mission in a structure focused on performances
and happenings called RedPlexus in la Friche la Belle de mai in Marseille.
Producer et distributor, this collective is working since twelve years
on the emergence of new artistic wrintings. They also participate
to deploy actions taken in public spaces. I am in charge of community
management, mediation but I am also working on events and production.
These elements helped me to open my xxxx ?
<br>
My graphic universe is basically built during my wanderings ;
walks, plants, travels, textures, paintings... They reflect a sensitivity.
I like to tell stories by the way of printed contents such as editorial
design, posters, postcards, XXX...
